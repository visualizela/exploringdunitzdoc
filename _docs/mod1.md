Robin Dunitz is a photographer, curator, and mural researcher who has written and co-written books on murals in California. As an Angeleño, Robin was involved with the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles (MCLA), serving as an Advisory Board Member and the organization’s tour director. 

The collection includes materials such as exhibition announcements, press releases, slides, photographs, newspaper clippings, artist bios/CV, personal notes, and fliers. Part of the collection is accessible via the Robin Dunitz California and Los Angeles Murals files at USC's Archicture and Fine Arts Library. An online collection, the Robin Dunitz Slides of Los Angeles Murals, is accessible online via the USC Digital Library. More info below:

Robin Dunitz California and Los Angeles Murals Files 
These files represent Dunitz' personal compilation of materials during her involvement in documenting and preserving Los Angeles murals, as well as writing about them. Contains 450+ files and 1000s of unique items. 

Robin Dunitz Slides of Los Angeles Murals, 1925-2002, Is the online image collection containing more than 2,000 digitized 35mm slides of murals in Los Angeles. The murals date from 1925 to the early 2000s and were photographed by Dunitz in the late 1980s to early 2000s. Both collections were donated to USC Libraries in the early 2000s. Many of the requests that I receive about this collection are from folks who are looking for images of murals that no longer exist for a variety of reasons or are looking for information about a local muralist.
