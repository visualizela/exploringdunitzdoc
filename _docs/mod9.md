##### You are now ready to work on your post. 

##### FIRST - A post is made up of two areas, the first part is a section that begins with three dashes and ends with three dashes. It is called the front matter of the post. This is where you will edit and put your name, the title, etc. of the post.

##### The part after the front matter is the rest of the post. This will be the text of the post.

##### The first thing to notice is the filename of the post towards the top of the screen. This needs to be UNIQUE. The file naming convention looks like this:

##### * YEAR-MONTH-DAY-SEMESTER-YOURUNIQUEID

##### The unique ID will be your USC email handle. For example, my email is arutkows @ usc.edu so my filename would be YEAR-MONTH-DAY-SEMESTER-ARUTKOWS

##### Once you click edit you will be able to see how the post is constructed. You will be replacing the info in the draft post with your own essay. It is important make changes carefully in order to keep the formatting so that the essay displays properly. These essays are constructed using markdown, which is very simple way to display html pages.
