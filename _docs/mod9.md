Images are added to the image folder. CLick on the image folder. Once you are in the folder you can simply click and drag on the image that you want to place into the folder. Your images should be relatively small in size, nothing larger than 1MB.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visualizela/exploringdunitzdoc/gh-pages/img/imageuploadgithub.gif"/>

Now lets go back to your post and try to publish this image to your website. You will follow the instructions in the draft post replacing the image url with the name of your image.

Once you have replaced the name. Commit it and go to your website to see the imaged displayed in your post.
