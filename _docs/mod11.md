#####  One of the final things you will do before finishing your post is renaming it. This needs to be UNIQUE. 

![Your GitHub account at the ExploringDunitz repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visualizela/exploringdunitzdoc/gh-pages/img/namingapost.jpg){: .center-image }

##### The file naming convention looks like this:

##### YEAR-MONTH-DAY-SEMESTER-YOURUNIQUEID

##### The unique ID will be your USC email handle. For example, if your email is arutkows @ usc.edu your file name will be 2018-11-05-FALL-ARUTKOWS

##### When you are ready to make a pull request make sure to have your file renamed appropriately.
